# Le Pain Rouge Theme Readme

##About Le Pain Rouge
This is a wordpress theme based on the RED Academy starter theme, forked from Underscores.

###Summary
A (fake) bakery website called Le Red Bread created in Wordpress featuring:
- A static home page with a hero banner, custom fields and taxonomies;
- a static custom about page and contact page;
- A blog page with individual blog post pages;
- A custom product page with a grid format to highlight products;
- Search results page and 404 page;


###Tools and methods used to build site:
HTML/CSS
PHP
Flexbox
Custom widget
Custom post type and taxonomy
Custom Field Suite, Contact Form 7
Debug Bar
Gulp, SASS, Browser-Sync

###Experience from the project:
Wordpress is a serious beast! It was great learning how to use php and the Wordpress way to create websites that allows clients to manage their content via a CMS in a simple and easy way. The custom form fields plugin is especially handy in creating fields that don't already exist, meaning that I can now alter existing themes to add in content areas for clients to manage.
This project also shows just how huge a custom wordpress project can be. The volume of pages is pretty massive and includes often overlooked pages like custom 404 and search results pages.
Learning to use Debug Bar was a nice trick too. Since PHP is a server side scripting language, any error displays a white screen and therefore sends you hunting for the error blind.
